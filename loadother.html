    <h1>Define HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>

    <div class="markdown-body"><section class="main"><p><strong>1. HTML is simple to understand and implement<strong></p><ul>
        <li>HTML is a simple language to learn and understand. HTML is the first and most important language that anyone learning web development will encounter. There are no complicated tags, and there is no case sensitivity with HTML.</li>
        <li>It consists of only a few tags that have a specific purpose. One can easily grasp othersâ€™ code and make adjustments if necessary, so there isn't much more to learn from it. Moreover, unlike other programming languages, it does not throw an error or cause a problem if the developer forgets to close the tags or makes a mistake in the code.</li>
        </ul><p><strong>2. HTML is completely free</strong></p><ul>
        <li>One of the biggest advantages of using HTML is that it is free, and no special software is required. HTML does not require any plugins, so one should not have to deal with them when working with any software.</li>
        <li>Even with many open-source content management systems, all necessary plugins are not always free. As a result, it is incredibly cost-effective from a per-business standpoint because there is no fee for obtaining the license if the entire website is constructed in HTML.</li>
        </ul><p><strong>3. Every browser supports HTML</strong></p><ul>
        <li>HTML is supported by nearly all browsers worldwide such as Google, Safari, Opera, etc. So there is no need to be concerned about a website built in HTML for browser support because the website will appear in all browsers if the program&nbsp;remembers to optimize the website for the different browsers.</li>
        <li>It is neither difficult nor complex to optimize an HTML-based website for browser compatibility. It gives web developers an easy way to optimize their websites for browsers.</li>
        </ul><p><strong>4. HTML is the most search engine friendly</strong></p><ul>
        <li>In comparison to other web programming languages on the market, HTML is one of the most user-friendly search engines (Search Engine friendly means delivering users quality websites with relevant information when searching for a particular one).</li>
        <li>HTML is far easier to use than other computer languages for creating <span class="highlight--red">SEO-compliant websites</span>. HTML websites are more accessible for web crawlers to read and access, reducing crawling time and page load time and so enhancing website performance.</li>
        <li>HTML generates the fewest SEO difficulties and offers the most flexibility when attempting to construct an SEO-compliant website. As long as you verify that your HTML code is clean and validated.</li>
